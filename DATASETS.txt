The data is showing the crime incidents reported in Boston provided by Boston Police Department (BPD).
There was a peak between 2016 and 2017 in the crimes reported. There also tends to be a higher number of crimes reported in July/August in all years.
	

	
This is the information form our primary dataset, but we did not know how to display the lines of data, and thus it is all unformatted.

Snippit of the Second Data File

We hope to gain knowledge on what crimes are most committed in Boston and if there is a trend with certain monnths and times of day
The second file shows what the relationship between the code and the crime is, which will be used to create a relationship between both the datasets. 
In utilizing both these files, we will gain better understanding in how to create one-to-many(1:m) relationships.
To gain further understanding of the nature of crimes in Boston, we would like to seek data on Bostons weather reports during the years of 2015-2018 and cross reference weather to times of crimes reported.
